# **Singapore Polytechnic Specialist Diploma in data science and artificial intelligence (Stock Prices Analysis)**
**Please refer to the jupyter notebook for more details**

## **Summary of Assignment Requirements:**
**Datasets:** 
You need to use at least 3 datasets from any data source - kaggle, data.gov.sg etc.

**Project requirements:**
**Use pandas** to extract useful statistical information from the datasets.
Use Matplotlib to create at least four types of graphs (bar chart, line chart, pie chart, histogram, scatterplot, boxplot, etc.).

## **PowerPoint Presentation:**
Include a cover page, a slide with dataset URLs, slides explaining each dataset, the analysis process, and insights gained.

## **Project Description**
This project aims to provide a data-driven approach to understanding and predicting stock market trends, specifically focusing on the S&P 500 index. The goal is to help individuals, particularly those new to investing, make informed decisions by leveraging historical stock data and machine learning techniques. The project is designed to educate users about the S&P 500, its growth trends, the sectors involved, and potential individual stocks to invest in. Additionally, it explores the use of machine learning models (XGBoost) to predict stock prices, highlighting both the potential and limitations of such models.

## **Data Analysis**
The analysis involves the following steps:

**1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the overall growth trend of the S&P 500, identifying key sectors, and analyzing market capitalization.**

**Machine Learning Model: Using the XGBoost algorithm to predict stock prices based on historical data. The model is trained on data up to January 1, 2021, and tested on data from January 1, 2021, onwards.**

**Feature Importance: Ranking the importance of different features used in the machine learning model to understand which factors most influence stock price predictions.**

**Bokeh: Using Bokeh to illusrate Meta, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google (MAANG) and Microsoft stock since inception to Jan 30 2025**
